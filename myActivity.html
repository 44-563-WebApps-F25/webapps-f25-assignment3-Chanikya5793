        <h2>Outdoor Photography</h2>
        <p>Photography is my favorite outdoor activity because it blends 
            <strong>creativity</strong> with patient <strong>observation</strong>, 
            helping capture fleeting light, textures, and candid moments. 
            I love exploring new places at golden hour, experimenting with composition, 
            and telling stories through images.</p>
